a simple project inspired from a udemy course

This is a project that is inspired from a famous udemy course by 'Jonas Schmedtmann'.

#The course link
https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/


I have not taken this course but I saw the course content and the final website.
I tried to build a clone.

#The goal was to give it a try.

#I am not an advanced CSS developer and I had no design at hand.

#I have tried to create the final version of Jonas's website but my project still lacks the hover effects,animations and some other minute details
and may not look exactly like Jonas's site.


#I have used flexbox in my project.
In future I will try to  add all the missing effects to this site and try to improve on my work.
